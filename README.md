ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Sahara Al-Madi

Iâ€™m interested in language technology, linguistics, education tech, and inclusive communication design

Iâ€™m currently learning how to integrate NLP tools and AI models into multilingual digital projects

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects involving language revitalization, ethical AI, multilingual SEO, and cross-cultural storytelling

Pronouns: she/her

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm interested in the correlation between storytelling and language learning. Iâ€™m also currently building RUYA: an experimental multilingual chatbot designed to support intercultural understanding and multilingual FAQ systems

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: language revitalization, AI in linguistics, wellness in tech, or my project Thought Flo Wellness (thoughtflowellness.org)
